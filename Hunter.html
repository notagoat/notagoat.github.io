			<p> This simulation uses the rate at which the cells gather food to calculate size. As the cells lose size as they move those that don't eat will eventually lose mass and fade out of existence. Each cell has randomly generated charateristics that act like genetics to allow the cells to be unique and allows those that have better genetics to survive. </p>
			<p> A notable factor is the rate at which cells can be seen to change. Those that deviate from the swarm are more likely to survive. This carries on until the majority of the swarm is now similar to the original cell. At this point a new type of cell that can turn faster or moves slightly slower may be at an advantage, causing the process to begin again. </p>
